# Forest cover type

To predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data).


## Technical Aspect

- Python
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook







## Dataset

Covertype Data Set Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.




## Feature Engineering

### ☑️ Data Analysis:

- Finding numeric and categorical columns
- Finding missing datas for numerical and categorical columns.
- To visualize and analyze the relationship between numeric features and target features.
- To visualize and analyse the relationship between categorical features and target features.
- To check correlation of data using heatmap
- Checking multicollinearity using VIF score.
- Checking outliers

### ☑️ Data Preprocessing:

- Imputing missing values if any.
- Removing outliers.
- Standard scaling of data.



## Model training and prediction

- Training and predicting the data using a Logistic regression model.
- Performing hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
- Evaluating the model using accuracy score.
